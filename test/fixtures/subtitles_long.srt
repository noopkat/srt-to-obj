You create the world of the dream.

320

We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

321
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,310
How could I ever acquire enough detail
to make them think that it's reality?

while we're in them, right?

00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,850
The infinite staircase.

509
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,520
See?

510
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,740
Paradox.

511
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,320
So a closed loop like that...

512
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,580
...will help you disguise the boundaries
of the dream you create.

513
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,700
But how big do these levels have to be?

514
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:31,040
It could be anything from
the floor of a building to an entire city.

515
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,630
They have to be complicated enough
that we can hide from the projections.

516
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,210
- A maze?
- Right, a maze.

517
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,710
And the better the maze...

518
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,550
Then the longer we have
before the projections catch us?

519
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,010
Exactly.

520
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,890
- My subconscious seems polite enough.
- Ha, ha. You wait, they'll turn ugly.

521
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,390
No one likes to feel someone else
messing around in their mind.

522
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,640
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?

523
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,310
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.

524
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,900
He thinks it's safer
if he doesn't know the layouts.

525
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,150
Why?

526
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,570
He won't tell me. But I think it's Mal.

527
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,280
- His ex-wife?
- No, not his ex.

528
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,620
- They're still together?
- No.

529
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,370
No, she's dead.

530
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,080
What you see in there
is just his projection of her.

531
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,090
What was she like in real life?

532
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,130
She was lovely.

533
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,350
YUSUF: You are seeking a chemist?
COBB: Yes.

534
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,640
To formulate compounds for a job?

535
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,180
And to go into the field with us.

536
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,600
No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.

537
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,480
Well, we'd need you there to tailor
compounds specific to our needs.

538
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,780
- Which are?
- Great depth.

539
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,200
A dream within a dream? Two levels?

540
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,990
Three.

541
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,750
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

542
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,870
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

543
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,710
A powerful sedative.

544
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,760
- How many team members?
- Five.

545
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,630
SAITO:
Six.

546
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,560
The only way to know you've done the job
is if I go in with you.

547
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,810
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

548
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,350
This time, it seems there is.

549
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,020
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

550
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,320
COBB: What for?
- Here, I'll show you.

551
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,370
Perhaps you will not want to see.

552
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,910
After you.

00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,760
You see? Very stable.

557
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,520
- How long do they dream for?
YUSUF: Three, four hours, each day.

558
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,860
In dream time?

559
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,700
With this compound? About 40 hours,
each and every day.

560
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,160
- Why do they do it?
YUSUF: Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

561
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,120
After a while, it becomes
the only way you can dream.

562
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:18,210
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

563
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,250
- They come here every day to sleep?
MAN: No.

564
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,710
They come to be woken up.

565
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,010
The dream has become their reality.

Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

COBB:
What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

576
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,450
That's not your concern.

577
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,210
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

578
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,960
You asked me for inception.

579
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,510
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

580
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:54,640
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

581
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,680
This idea will define him.

582
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,680
It may come to change...

583
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,140
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:05,650
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

585
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,900
And we can no longer compete.

Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

587
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,070
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

to change his mind.

That's where we come in.

How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

591
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,880
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

592
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,550
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

593
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,920
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

594
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:37,260
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

Mr. Browning...

599
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,200
...Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation.

600
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:01,200
Well, shall we voice your concerns
with Maurice directly?

601
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:02,790
Not sure that's necessary.

602
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,620
No, no, no. I think we should.

How is he?

604
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,070

unnecessarily, but...

the damn... Wait. So do it. Get...

MAURICE: Put it through.

607
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,080
Never, never.
Never do the same as I asked.

608
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,040
Leave that.

00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,090

BROWNING:
Must be a cherished memory of his.

611
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,430
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

612
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,270
Robert...

613
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,020
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

- Not now, Uncle Peter.

00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,870
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

617
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,450
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

618
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,460
...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

619
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,460
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

620
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,880
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

621
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,890
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

622
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,560
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

623
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,640
So he gives himself the idea.

624
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:51,060
Precisely. That's the only way it will
stick. It has to seem self-generated.

625
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:54,650
Eames, I am impressed.

No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

630
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,510
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

631
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,350
Yeah, I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.

632
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,690
Here, let me take a look.

633
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,190
So you're learning, huh?

634
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,860
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

635
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,860
- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

636
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,200
It was Mal's, actually. This...

637
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,660
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

638
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,750
Just spin and spin.

639
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,210
Arthur told me she passed away.

640
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,210
How are the mazes coming along?

641
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,260
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

642
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,880
...that we are trying to access.

643
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:09,520
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

644
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:12,640
You know, l... Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

645
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:17,560
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

646
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:18,900
Why is that so important?

647
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,070
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

648
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,570
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

649
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,410
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

650
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,990
You can't keep her out, can you?

651
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,410
- Right.
- You can't build...

652
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,920
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

653
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,250
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

654
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:41,260
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

655
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,630
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

656
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,760
No one said it's getting worse.

657
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,260
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

658
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,180
Why can't you go home?

659
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,310
Because they think I killed her.

660
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,820
- Thank you.
- For what?

661
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,280
For not asking whether I did.

662
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,620
"I will split up my father's empire."

663
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:13,000
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

664
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,960
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

665
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,670
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

666
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,630
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

667
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,220
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

668
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,970
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

669
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,890
...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

670
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,640
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

671
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,310
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

672
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,400
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

673
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:48,320
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

674
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,320
All right, well, try this. Um...

675
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:55,250
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

676
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,710
That might work.

677
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,040
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

678
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,170
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

679
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,300
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

680
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,590
Specificity?

681
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,590
Inception's not about being specific.

682
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,720
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

683
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,020
EAMES: On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

684
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,270
...and say, "I will not follow
in my father's footsteps."

685
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,110
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

686
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,610
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

687
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,200
- "My father doesn't want me to be him."
EAMES: Exactly.

Three layers down, the dreams are gonna
collapse with the slightest disturbance.

690
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,870
Sedation.

691
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,870
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

692
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,960
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

(MACHINE HISSING)

694
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,470
Good night.

695
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,270
YUSUF: The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

696
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,400
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

697
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,780
...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

698
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,070
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

699
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,780
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

700
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,080
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...

701
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,120
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

702
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,960
It's a week, the first level down.

703
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,500
Six months the second level down,
and the third level...

704
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,090
That's 10 years.

705
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,930
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

706
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,470
Depends on the dream.

707
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,930
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

708
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,430
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

709
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,390
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

710
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,270
EAMES:
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

711
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,110
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

712
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,490
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

713
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,870
YUSUF:
That's the clever part.

714
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,290
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

715
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:03,290
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

716
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,790
Or tipping.

717
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,630
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

718
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,680
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

He makes it every two weeks.

726
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,160

maintenance with his plane.

- Why's that?

729
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,880
On a 747, the pilot's up top...

730
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,260
...the first-class cabin's in the nose,
so no one would walk through.

731
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,930
You'd have to buy out the entire cabin
and the first-class flight attendant.

732
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,680
I bought the airline.

733
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,020
It seemed neater.

734
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,440
Well, looks like we have our 10 hours.

you were the only one able to open it.

No, he never gave me any combination.

just didn't know it was a combination.

Well, what, then?

981

you know what he told me?

01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:08,370
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

987
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,870
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

988
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,750
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

989
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,750
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

990
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,510
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

991
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,930
And if he dies?

992
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,550
Worst-case scenario?

993
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,430
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,690

They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

1008
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:14,730
All right. What is in the safe?

1009
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:16,980
Something for you.

1010
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:21,730
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

1011
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:25,570
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1012
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:26,950
That's an alternate.

1013
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,490
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

1014
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,290
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

1015
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:36,170
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

1016
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,790
Destroying my whole inheritance?

1017
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,630
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

1018
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:48,470
He loved you, Robert.

1019
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,680
In his own way.

1020
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,640
FISCHER:
In his own way.

1021
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:55,480
At the end...

1022
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,940
...he called me in to his deathbed.

1023
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,270
He could barely speak.

1024
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:06,610
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

1025
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,740
He pulled me close.

1026
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,500
And I could only make out...

1027
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:17,790
...one word.

1028
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,460
"Disappointed."

1029
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,970
(SIGHS)

1030
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,300
When were you in limbo?

1031
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,390
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

1032
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,940
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

1033
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:42,270
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

1034
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,490
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

1035
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:49,070
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

1036
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,030
...we're also going deeper into you.

1037
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:55,160
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

1038
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:00,620
We were working together.

1039
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:04,460
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

1040
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,920
I kept pushing things.

1041
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:09,760
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

1042
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:15,140
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

1043
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:18,020
...that we could get trapped so deep...

1044
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,190
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

1045
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:25,320
...we lost sight of what was real.

1046
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,950
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

1047
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,580
We did that for years.

1048
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,710
We built our own world.

1049
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,750
How long were you stuck there?

1050
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,050
Something like 50 years.

1051
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:51,590
Jesus.

1052
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,220
How could you stand it?

1053
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:58,140
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

1054
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:01,350
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

1055
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,900
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

1056
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:07,480
And what about for her?

1057
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:14,870
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1058
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:21,500
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1059
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,920
Limbo became her reality.

1060
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:30,090
What happened when you woke up?

1061
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:34,260
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

1062
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:39,850
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

1063
01:17:40,770 --> 01:17:44,520
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

1064
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,150
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1065
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,940
She was possessed by an idea.

1066
01:17:52,110 --> 01:17:57,830
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

1067
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:01,450
That our world wasn't real.

1068
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:06,630
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

1069
01:18:07,170 --> 01:18:09,550
...that in order to get back home...

1070
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,590
...we had to kill ourselves.

1071
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:22,680
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

1072
01:18:22,850 --> 01:18:25,850
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

1073
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,730
MAL: I'm their mother!
COBB: Calm down.

1074
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,150
I can tell the difference.

1075
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,650
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

1076
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,530
You don't know you're dreaming!

1077
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:35,900
COBB: She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

1078
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:39,910
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1079
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:45,910
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

1080
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:52,590
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

1081
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,450
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1082
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:25,870
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1083
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:30,500
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1084
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:32,380
No, I'm not.

1085
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,630
Now, you listen to me.

1086
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:39,470
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1087
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,550
Now, just step back inside.

1088
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,470
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1089
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,560
We've talked enough.

1090
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,310
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1091
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,190
...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1092
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,240
We're gonna talk about this.

1093
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:01,280
All right?

1094
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:06,540
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1095
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,500
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1096
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:13,420
Take a second, think about our children.

1097
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,340
Think about James.

1098
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:17,710
Think about Phillipa, now.

1099
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,800
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1100
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:24,260
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1101
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,060
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1102
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,440
How you've threatened to kill me.

1103
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,860
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1104
01:20:38,030 --> 01:20:39,780
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?

1105
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,820
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1106
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:46,030
We're going home to our real children.

1107
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,830
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1108
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,290
You're waiting for a train.

1109
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:55,380
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1110
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,550
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1111
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:01,550
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1112
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,930
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1113
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,310
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1114
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:11,310
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1115
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,900
Jesus Christ!

1116
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,150
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1117
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,490
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1118
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,910
So I ran.

1119
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,580
(CHILDREN GIGGLING)

1120
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:30,000
MAN:
Right now, or never, Cobb.

1121
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:41,010
WOMAN:
James! Phillipa! Come on in! Come on!

1122
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:42,340
All right, let's go.

1123
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,680
I left my children behind and I've been
trying to buy my way back ever since.

1124
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,100
Your guilt defines her.
It's what powers her.

1125
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:54,560
But you are not responsible
for the idea that destroyed her.

1126
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,360
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1127
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:03,530
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1128
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,530
But you don't have to do that alone.

1129
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,950
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1130
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:13,710
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1131
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,300
We have to move.

1132
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:21,880
Time's up.

1133
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,800
All right. I don't know any combination.

1134
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:28,050
- Not consciously, anyway.
COBB: How about instinctively, huh?

1135
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:32,180
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1136
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:35,230
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1137
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,650
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1138
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:40,070
I said, right now! Right now!

1139
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:44,110
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1140
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:49,990
You'll have to do better than that.

1141
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:53,500
All right. Bag them.
You're going for a ride.

1142
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:02,000
FISCHER: We're worth more to you alive.
You hear me?

1143
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:08,760
What'd you get?

1144
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,720
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1145
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:12,930
This helps us how?

1146
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:16,180
The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

1147
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,480
- How are we gonna reconcile them?
- I'm working on that.

1148
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,190
Work faster.
The projections are closing in quick.

1149
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,950
We gotta break out of here
before we're totally boxed in.

1150
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:04,070
Damn it.

1151
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:07,240
You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1152
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,010
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1153
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:31,180
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1154
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:33,680
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1155
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:36,850
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1156
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,350
His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

1157
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,020
- I think we run with Mr. Charles.
- No.

1158
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,860
EAMES: Who's Mr. Charles?
- Bad idea.

1159
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,570
The second we get into that hotel
his security's gonna be all over us.

1160
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,860
We run with Mr. Charles
like on the Stein job.

1161
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,360
- You've done it before?
ARTHUR: Yeah, and it didn't work.

1162
01:24:52,530 --> 01:24:56,030
The subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to pieces.

1163
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,200
Excellent. But you learned a lot, right?

1164
01:24:58,370 --> 01:25:00,500
- I need some kind of distraction.
EAMES: No problem.

1165
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,870
How about a lovely lady
that I've used before?

1166
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,090
Listen to me.
You drive carefully, all right?

1167
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,710
Everything down there is
gonna be unstable as hell.

1168
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:15,640
Don't jump too soon. We only got
one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

1189
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:29,960

against his own subconscious.

...which involves attracting
a lot of attention to us.

- Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
- Hmm.

from your subconscious.

It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1294
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,910
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,410

- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1300

While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1302
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:42,390
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1303
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,730
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1304
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,320
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1305
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,740
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

- Right.

Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

his motives the way we want him to.

was because I did it to her first.

02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,720
What?

1674
02:10:40,150 --> 02:10:41,280
Come on, come on.

1675
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,020
Dad?

1676
02:11:14,810 --> 02:11:15,850
(SOBBING)

1677
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:54,430
That's the kick, Ariadne!
You have to go now!

1678
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:10,700
Don't lose yourself!
Find Saito and bring him back!

1679
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:12,530
I will!

1680
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:55,450
You remember when you asked me
to marry you?

1681
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:56,750
Yes.

1682
02:12:56,910 --> 02:12:59,960
You said you dreamt
that we'd grow old together.

1683
02:13:02,670 --> 02:13:04,170
But we did.

1684
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:08,470
We did. You don't remember?

1685
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:15,970
I miss you more than I can bear...

1686
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:20,350
...but we had our time together.

1687
02:13:21,690 --> 02:13:23,770
And I have to let you go.

1688
02:13:25,860 --> 02:13:27,650
I have to let you go.

1689
02:14:18,910 --> 02:14:20,200
I'm sorry, Robert.

1690
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:43,600
(ARTHUR YELLS)

1691
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:51,530
You know, the will means that Dad
wanted me to be my own man...

1692
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:54,660
...not just to live for him.

1693
02:14:56,240 --> 02:14:58,780
That's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.

1694
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:09,800
What happened?

1695
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:11,960
- Cobb stayed.
- With Mal?

1696
02:15:12,130 --> 02:15:13,380
No, to find Saito.

1697
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:17,430
He'll be lost.

1698
02:15:19,970 --> 02:15:21,810
No, he'll be all right.

1699
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,780
SAITO:
Have you come to kill me?

1700
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:46,540
I'm waiting for someone.

1701
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,760
COBB:
Someone from a half-remembered dream.

1702
02:15:56,510 --> 02:15:57,930
Cobb?

1703
02:15:58,640 --> 02:15:59,680
(SCOFFS)

1704
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:01,600
Impossible.

1705
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:04,770
We were young men together.

1706
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:08,690
I'm an old man.

1707
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:11,980
Filled with regret.

1708
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,820
Waiting to die alone.

1709
02:16:20,990 --> 02:16:23,160
I've come back for you.

1710
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:30,290
To remind you of something.

1711
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:35,960
Something you once knew.

1712
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,050
That this world is not real.

1713
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:50,480
To convince me to honor
our arrangement?

1714
02:16:51,310 --> 02:16:54,070
To take a leap of faith, yes.

1715
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:01,490
Come back...

1716
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:07,410
...so we can be
young men together again.

1717
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:13,170
Come back with me.

1718
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:17,670
Come back.

1719
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:29,140
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Hot towel, sir?

1720
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:32,650
We'll be landing in Los Angeles
in about 20 minutes.

1721
02:17:32,810 --> 02:17:35,110
Do you need immigration forms?

1722
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:38,530
Thank you.

1723
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:40,650
Hot towel, sir?

1724
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:44,660
- No.
- Do you need immigration forms?

1725
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:57,110
Welcome home, Mr. Cobb.

1726
02:18:58,230 --> 02:18:59,860
Thank you, sir.

1727
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:45,280
Welcome.

1728
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:47,160
This way.

1729
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:11,810
MILES:
James? Phillipa?

1730
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:16,810
Look who's here.

1731
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:23,480
Hey.

1732
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:27,280
- Hey, guys! Hey! How are you?
PHILLIPA: Daddy! Daddy!

1733
02:20:27,450 --> 02:20:29,700
JAMES: Daddy!
COBB: How are you?

1734
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:32,410
Look what I've been building!

1735
02:20:32,580 --> 02:20:36,290
- What are you building?
JAMES: We're building a house on the cliff!

1736
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:39,330
COBB: On the cliff? Come on, I want you
to show me. Can you show me?

1737
02:20:39,500 --> 02:20:42,040
JAMES: Let's go.
PHILLIPA: Come on, Daddy!
